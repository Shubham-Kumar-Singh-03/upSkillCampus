This repository contains the code and documentation for my six-week internship project with upSkill Campus and IoT Academy under the collaboration of UniCoverage Technology. The project focuses on developing a Java-based application with functionalities related to Bank management and transactional operations. The problem statement involved creating a system that allowed users to register, log in, and perform various actions such as depositing, withdrawing, and changing their PIN. The project also included the implementation of a database for storing user information and transaction history. Through this internship, I had the opportunity to gain practical experience in Core Java and work on real-world applications.

## Overview

In this internship, I embarked on a journey of exploration, planning, and implementation. I began by familiarizing myself with the problem statement and acquiring essential knowledge about UniCoverage Technology and its initiatives in the digital transformation domain. This included understanding their products and solutions leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and more.

Throughout the six weeks, I meticulously planned and executed my project, which involved creating login and signup pages, implementing database functionalities, and designing transactional features. I also gained insights into industry practices, such as industry 4.0, predictive maintenance, and the benefits of digital twins.
